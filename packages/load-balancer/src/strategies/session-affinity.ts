/**
 * SessionAffinityStrategy — a hybrid of SessionStrategy and LeastUsedStrategy.
 *
 * Routing is keyed on the *client* session id (request body
 * `metadata.user_id`, threaded through as {@link RequestMeta.clientSessionId}):
 *
 *   - The first request of a new client-session is routed to the least-loaded
 *     available account (same least-used scoring as LeastUsedStrategy, with the
 *     recency penalty so concurrently-starting sessions spread across the pool).
 *   - That client→account mapping is then made STICKY for `affinityTtlMs`, so
 *     every subsequent request from the same client keeps hitting the same
 *     upstream → prompt-cache affinity is preserved across the agentic loop.
 *
 * The result: many concurrent client-sessions are spread across all healthy
 * accounts (one account is no longer maxed before the next is touched, the
 * sequential-exhaustion failure mode of SessionStrategy), while each individual
 * session still keeps its cache locality (which per-request LeastUsedStrategy
 * throws away).
 *
 * Trade-off:
 *   - vs SessionStrategy: SessionStrategy tracks ONE account-level session and
 *     funnels ALL traffic to it until it rate-limits/expires, then rotates —
 *     maxing one account before the next. SessionAffinity instead pins each
 *     client to its own account, so N concurrent clients use up to N accounts.
 *   - vs LeastUsedStrategy: LeastUsed spreads every individual request and so
 *     loses prompt-cache reuse. SessionAffinity keeps a client glued to one
 *     account, trading some instantaneous load-evenness for cache hits.
 *
 * When the pinned account is temporarily unavailable (rate-limited), the
 * mapping is intentionally NOT deleted: we fail the client over to the
 * least-used available account for the duration, but snap it back to its
 * original account once that recovers (mirrors the SessionStrategy issue #115
 * reasoning — the prompt-cache window outlives the rate-limit window).
